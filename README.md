# Coffee
Research project to build an automatic coffee machine accessible and programmable with Bluetooth LE (4.0).
Uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (that has integrated bluetooth) to keep track of the coffee scheduled and to trigger the coffee.
One of the objectives was to interface Raspberry Pi and a PLC to prove the advantages of using bluetooth in industries to eliminate the need of a tremendous amount of wires.
Uses PhoneGap to host the application as a website on a server than can be accessed by any phone OS.
